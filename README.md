# Context
This project takes part in the evaluation of what we learned and understood about our .Net lessons. It'sa conclusion of a 5 month lessons where we learned to create and secure a website from the DB to the user interface using SqlServer / Ado.Net, Asp.Net (MVC) , Session Manager, and building DAL and BLL manually

## The project
We had 4 days to build a web a webapp allowing users to own, lean and return boardgames. (like myLudo). The boardgames had to have tags to facilitate the sorting when searching for them.

## Auto Evaluation 
I'v felt a lot of frustration concerning the deadline, I've seen just by reading the instructions that I won't be able to deliver all the points asked in the allocated time.
My strategy: showing that I understood the content of our lessons and showing it through this test. I chose to not implement everything but what is implemented had to be near perfection. and without bugs.
- I implemented the User and Boardgame Library frm DB to UI
- I secured the login and logout and routing through the Session Manager
- I personnalised validators for the routing and subscription

## Teacher's collegue feedback
Our work was corrected and evaluated by a teacher's colleague to insure objective feedback on the work given. 
The evaluator said he was impressed by the quality of the work given in the such short schedule, and that my frustration was normal because they purposely gave too much work to do, to see how we would react to the pressure and the strategies we implemented. 
I apparently choose a good strategy and he really liked my little personnalisations I put in the projects that were not asked but showed that I enjoyed doing it and really understood the lessons. 
To have a perfect project:
  - some try catch were missing but nothing with too much impact,
  - a little bug in my cookie policy (the consent wasn't compulsory)
  - a little bug on the soft delete I implemented in the last minutes of the examination.
I felt really proud when he said I gave a junior ++ work, a quality from one of his own junior collegue can give. 

## Push the project further
- Being able to add friends and their libraries in my account
- Transmission of the URL when redirection to login etc to improve UX
- Give the user the possibility to login via mail or pseudo
- Insert profile picture
- If login and isn't known, redirect to register pag
- If user want to create an account but the identifiers are linked to a deactivated account, ask the user if he wants to reactivate his account
- Check owner for the addInLibrary route
- Filter only the active games in the list
- Update state of the game
